    <br>PC Dave Wardell, from Buntingford, Herefordshire and his dog Finn, have been announced as the winners of the Kennel Club Friends for Life competition at Crufts 2019.
    <p>Retired Police Dog (RPD) Finn was stabbed several times as he protected Dave from an armed attack in 2016, saving his life. Finn was badly injured and his fight for his life led the duo to launch the ‘Finns Law’ campaign, highlighting the value of all service animals and the injustice of their treatment in the law.</p>
    <p>The campaign is driving a new Bill which aims to make attacking a service animal a specific criminal offence, which through sustained campaigning by Dave and Finn, is now in its final stages in the House of Lords.</p>

    <br>Finn, owned by PC Dave Wardell, was one of five hero dogs shortlisted for the Friends for Life competition in February. The finalists shared their unique stories of the impact that each dog has made on their life, with the nation voting for their favourite finalist. The winner was announced in the Resorts World Arena on the final day of the world’s greatest dog show by hero soldier Ben Parkinson. <a href="https://www.feedsgola.com">Read Full Article</a> <a href="https://www.petsmag.co.uk/blog/nations-top-canine-hero-is-honoured">Visit Wbsite</a></p>
