    <br>PC Dave Wardell, from Buntingford, Herefordshire and his dog Finn, have been announced as the winners of the Kennel Club Friends for Life competition at Crufts 2019.
    <p>Retired Police Dog (RPD) Finn was stabbed several times as he protected Dave from an armed attack in 2016, saving his life. Finn was badly injured and his fight for his life led the duo to launch the ‘Finns Law’ campaign, highlighting the value of all service animals and the injustice of their treatment in the law.</p>
    <p>The campaign is driving a new Bill which aims to make attacking a service animal a specific criminal offence, which through sustained campaigning by Dave and Finn, is now in its final stages in the House of Lords.</p>

    <br>Finn, owned by PC Dave Wardell, was one of five hero dogs shortlisted for the Friends for Life competition in February. The finalists shared their unique stories of the impact that each dog has made on their life, with the nation voting for their favourite finalist. The winner was announced in the Resorts World Arena on the final day of the world’s greatest dog show by hero soldier Ben Parkinson. <a href="https://www.feedsgola.com">Read Full Article</a> <a href="https://www.petsmag.co.uk/blog/nations-top-canine-hero-is-honoured">Visit Wbsite</a></p>

    <p>A story written by one of the UK’s leading meditation teachers from his home in County Durham is capturing the hearts and spiritual minds of dog lovers across the globe.</p>
    <p>Gary Heads has been practising meditation for more than 30 years and has helped thousands of people find a sense of calm, from those struggling with mental health issues to people wanting to find a way to deal with stress</p>

    <br>Now Gary is spreading his message even further with the launch of his characterful new book, ‘The Enlightened Spaniel: A Dog’s Quest to be a Buddhist’, which is told from the point of view of his own pets – Ella and Indi
    <p>The charming story of The Enlightened Spaniel unfolds as Indi, the narrator, and Ella set off on a journey to learn about the reason their ‘dad’ meditates. Gary has weaved all his considerable knowledge into a book, which, thanks to its Spaniel storytellers, is an easy to understand, joyful read.</p>
    <p>Said Gary: “I’ve taught meditation for years and a lot of the literature around it can be very academic. I wanted to reach a wider audience but I also wanted to write a book that had humour. I didn’t write the book specifically to appeal to anyone with a Springer Spaniel but it naturally appeals to them.”</p>
